size = 10

for i in range(size):
    print("*")


# This code prints a vertical line of asterisks (*) with a length of 10 characters.
# The outer loop iterates 10 times, and in each iteration, it prints a single asterisk followed by a newline character.
# As a result, each asterisk is printed on a new line, creating a vertical line of 10 asterisks.
# After the loop completes, the cursor moves to the next line after printing the last asterisk.
# The print() function without any arguments at the end ensures that the cursor moves to the next line after printing all asterisks.
# The end="" argument in the print function is not used here, so the default behavior of moving to a new line after each print is applied.
# The result is a vertical line of asterisks, with each asterisk on its own line.
# The print() function at the end of each iteration moves the output to a new line.
