# Facts (set): Unordered collection of known truths (starting knowledge).
# Rules (dictionary): Conditional logic saying if one fact is true, then another becomes true.
# Forward Chaining: Starts from facts, applies rules, and keeps inferring new facts until no more rules apply.
# Ordered Facts (list): Used to track the order in which facts are added, which sets do not do.

# Output:
# Initial fact: {'sunny', 'weekend'}
# Inferred: go_outside
# Inferred: have_free_time
# Inferred: wear_sunglasses
# Inferred: look_cool
# Inferred: take_selfie
# Inferred: post_on_instagram
